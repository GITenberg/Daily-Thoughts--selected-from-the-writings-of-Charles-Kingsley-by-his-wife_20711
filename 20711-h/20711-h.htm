<p>Welcome, wild North-easter!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame it is to see<br />
Odes to every zephyr:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne&rsquo;er a verse to thee.<br />
. . . . .<br />
Tired we are of summer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tired of gaudy glare,<br />
Showers soft and steaming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hot and breathless air.<br />
Tired of listless dreaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the lazy day:<br />
Jovial wind of winter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn us out to play!<br />
Sweep the golden reed-beds;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crisp the lazy dyke;<br />
Hunger into madness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every plunging pike.<br />
Fill the lake with wild-fowl;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill the marsh with snipe;<br />
While on dreary moorlands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lonely curlew pipe.<br />
Through the black fir forest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thunder harsh and dry,<br />
Shattering down the snow-flakes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Off the curdled sky.<br />
. . . . .<br />
Come; and strong within us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stir the Viking&rsquo;s blood;<br />
Bracing brain and sinew:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow, thou wind of God!</p>

<h3>The Nineteenth Century.&nbsp; January 2.</h3>
<p>Now, and at no other time: in this same nineteenth century 
lies our work.&nbsp; Let us thank God that we are here now, and 
joyfully try to understand <i>where</i> we are, and what our work
is <i>here</i>.&nbsp; As for all superstitions about &ldquo;the 
good old times,&rdquo; and fancies that <i>they</i> belonged to 
God, while this age belongs only to man, blind chance, and the 
evil one, let us cast them from us as the suggestions of an evil 
lying spirit, as the natural parents of laziness, pedantry, 
fanaticism, and unbelief.&nbsp; And therefore let us not fear to 
ask the meaning of this present day, and of all its different 
voices&mdash;the pressing, noisy, complex present, where our 
workfield lies, the most intricate of all states of society, and 
of all schools of literature yet known.</p>

<h3>Forward.&nbsp; January 3.</h3>
<p>Let us forward.&nbsp; God leads us.&nbsp; Though blind, shall 
we be afraid to follow?&nbsp; I do not see my way: I do not care 
to: but I know that He sees His way, and that I see Him.</p>

And so make life, and death, and that For Ever<br />

<h3>Duty and Sentiment.&nbsp; January 5.</h3>
<p>God demands not <i>sentiment</i> but <i>justice</i>.&nbsp; The
Bible knows nothing of &ldquo;the religious sentiments and 
emotions&rdquo; whereof we hear so much talk nowadays.&nbsp; It 
speaks of <i>Duty</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved, if God so loved us, 
we <i>ought</i> to love one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>National Sermons</i>.&nbsp;

<h3>The Everlasting Harmony.&nbsp; January 6.</h3>
<p>If thou art living a righteous and useful life, doing thy duty
orderly and cheerfully where God has put thee, then thou in thy 
humble place art humbly copying the everlasting harmony and 
melody which is in heaven; the everlasting harmony and melody by 
which God made the world and all that therein is&mdash;and behold
it was very good&mdash;in the day when the morning stars sang 
together and all the sons of God shouted for joy over the 
new-created earth, which God had made to be a pattern of His own 
perfection.</p>

7</span>The Keys of Death and Hell.&nbsp; January 7.</h3>
<p>Fear not.&nbsp; Christ has the keys of death and hell.&nbsp; 
He has been through them and is alive for evermore.&nbsp; Christ 
is the <i>first</i>, and was loving and just and glorious and 
almighty before there was any death or hell.&nbsp; And Christ is 
the <i>last</i>, and will be loving and just and glorious and 
almighty as ever, in that great day when all enemies shall be 
under His feet, and death shall be destroyed, and death and hell 
shall be cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>MS. Sermon</i>.&nbsp; 1857.</p>
<h3>A Living God.&nbsp; January 8.</h3>
<p>Here and there, among rich and poor, there are those whose 
heart and flesh, whose conscience and whose intellect, cry out 
for the <i>Living</i> God, and will know no peace till they have 
found Him.&nbsp; For till then they can find no explanation of 
the three great human questions&mdash;Where am I?&nbsp; Whither 
am I going?&nbsp; What must I do?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sermons on the 
Pentateuch</i>.&nbsp; 1862.</p>
<h3>The Fairy Gardens.&nbsp; January 9.</h3>
<p>Of all the blessings which the study of Nature brings to the 
patient observer, let none, perhaps, be classed higher than this,
that the farther he enters into those fairy gardens of life and 
birth, which Spenser saw and described in his great poem, the 
more he learns the awful and yet comfortable truth, that they do 
not belong to him, but to One greater, wiser, lovelier than he; 
and as he stands, silent with awe, amid the pomp of 
Nature&rsquo;s ever-busy rest, hears as of old, The Word of the 
&ldquo;Lord God walking among the trees of the garden in the cool
of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Glaucus</i>.&nbsp; 1855.</p>
<h3><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>Love.&nbsp; January 10.</h3>
<p>Oh!&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; Love! the same in peasant 
and in peer!&nbsp; The more honour to you, then, old Love, to 
<i>be</i> the same thing in this world which <i>is</i> common to 
peasant and to peer.&nbsp; They say that you are blind, a 
dreamer, an exaggerator&mdash;a liar, in short!&nbsp; They just 
know nothing about you, then.&nbsp; You will not see people as 
they seem&mdash;as they have become, no doubt; but why?&nbsp; 
Because you see them as they ought to be, and are in some deep 
way eternally, in the sight of Him who conceived and created 
them!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Two Years Ago</i>, chap. 
xiv.&nbsp; 1856.</p>
<h3>Life&mdash;Love.&nbsp; January 11.</h3>
<p>We must live nobly to love nobly.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>MS.</i></p>
<h3>The Seed of Good.&nbsp; January 12.</h3>
<p>Never was the young Abbot heard to speak harshly of any human 
being.&nbsp; &ldquo;When thou hast tried in vain for seven 
years,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;to convert a sinner, then 
only wilt thou have a right to suspect him of being a worse man 
than thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp; That there is a seed of good in all 
men, a divine word and spirit striving with all men, a gospel and
good news which would turn the hearts of all men, if abbots and 
priests could but preach it aright, was his favourite doctrine, 
and one which he used to defend, when at rare intervals he 
allowed himself to discuss any subject, from the writings of his 
favourite theologian, Clement of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Above all, Abbot Philamon stopped by stern rebuke any attempt 
to revile either heretics or heathens.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the 
Catholic Church alone,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;lies the 
blame of all heresy and unbelief; for if she were but for one day
that which she ought to be, the world would be converted before 
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Hypatia</i>, chap. xxx.&nbsp; 
1852.</p>
<h3><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>Danger of Thinking vaguely.&nbsp; January 13.</h3>
<p>Watch against any fallacies in your ideas which may arise, not
from disingenuousness, but from allowing yourself in moments of 
feeling to think vaguely, and not to attach precise meaning to 
your words.&nbsp; Without any cold caution of expression, it is a
duty we owe to God&rsquo;s truth, and to our own happiness and 
the happiness of those around us, to think and speak as correctly
as we can.&nbsp; Almost all heresy, schism, and 
misunderstandings, between either churches or individuals who 
ought to be one, have arisen from this fault of an involved and 
vague style of thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>MS.</i>&nbsp; 1842.</p>
<h3>The Possession of Faith.&nbsp; January 14.</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to possess a faith, I want a faith which 
will possess me.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Hypatia</i>, chap. xvii.&nbsp; 
1852.</p>
<h3>The Eternal Life.&nbsp; January 15.</h3>
<p>Eternally, and for ever, in heaven, says St. John, Christ says
and is and does what prophets prophesied of Him that He would say
and be and do.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the Root and the Offspring of 
David, the bright Morning Star.&nbsp; And let him that is 
athirst, come: and whosoever will, let him take of the Water of 
Life freely.&rdquo;&nbsp; For ever Christ calls to every anxious 
soul, every afflicted soul, to every man who is ashamed of 
himself, and angry with himself, and longs to live a gentler, 
nobler, purer, truer, and more useful life, &ldquo;Come, and live
for ever the eternal life of righteousness, holiness, and peace, 
and joy in the Holy Spirit, which is the one true and only 
salvation bought for us by the precious blood of Christ our 
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h3><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>The Golden Cup of Youth.&nbsp; January 16.</h3>
<p>Ah, glorious twenty-one, with your inexhaustible powers of 
doing and enjoying, eating and hungering, sleeping and sitting 
up, reading and playing!&nbsp; Happy are those who still possess 
you, and can take their fill of your golden cup, steadied, but 
not saddened, by the remembrance that for all things a good and 
loving God will bring them to judgment!</p>
<p>Happier still those who (like a few) retain in body and soul 
the health and buoyancy of twenty-one on to the very verge of 
forty, and, seeming to grow younger-hearted as they grow 
older-headed, can cast off care and work at a moment&rsquo;s 
warning, laugh and frolic now as they did twenty years ago, and 
say with Wordsworth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So was it when I was a boy,<br />
So let it be when I am old,<br />
Or let me die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Two Years Ago</i>, chap. 
xix.&nbsp; 1856.</p>
<h3>Work and Duty.&nbsp; January 17.</h3>
<p>If a man is busy, and busy about his duty, what more does he 
require for time or for eternity?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Chalk Stream Studies</i>.&nbsp; 
1856.</p>
<h3>Members of Christ.&nbsp; January 18.</h3>
<p>. . . Would you be humble, daughter?<br />
You must look up, not down, and see yourself<br />
A paltry atom, sap-transmitting vein<br />
Of Christ&rsquo;s vast vine; the pettiest joint and member<br />
Of His great body. . . .</p>
<p>. . . Let thyself die&mdash;<br />
And dying, rise again to fuller life.<br />
To be a whole is to be small and weak&mdash;<br />
To be a part is to be great and mighty<br />
In the one spirit of the mighty whole&mdash;<br />
The spirit of the martyrs and the saints.</p>

<h3><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>Beauty a Sacrament.&nbsp; January 19.</h3>
<p>Never lose an opportunity of seeing anything beautiful.&nbsp; 
Beauty is God&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;a way-side sacrament; 
welcome it in every fair face, every fair sky, every fair flower,
and thank Him for it, who is the Fountain of all loveliness, and 
drink it in simply and earnestly with all your eyes; it is a 
charmed draught, a cup of blessing.</p>

<h3>The Ideal of Rank.&nbsp; January 20.</h3>
<p>With Christianity came in the thought that domination meant 
responsibility, that responsibility demanded virtue.&nbsp; The 
words which denoted Rank came to denote, likewise, high moral 
excellencies.&nbsp; The <i>nobilis</i>, or man who was known, and
therefore subject to public opinion, was bound to behave 
nobly.&nbsp; The gentle-man&mdash;gentile-man&mdash;who respected
his own gens, or family, or pedigree, was bound to be 
gentle.&nbsp; The courtier who had picked up at court some touch 
of Roman civilisation from Roman ecclesiastics was bound to be 
courteous.&nbsp; He who held an &ldquo;honour,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;edel&rdquo; of land, was bound to be honourable; and he 
who held a &ldquo;weorthig,&rdquo; or &ldquo;worthy,&rdquo; 
thereof, was bound himself to be worthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Lectures on Ancien 
R&eacute;gime</i>.&nbsp; 1866.</p>
<h3>An Indulgent God.&nbsp; January 21.</h3>
<p>A merely indulgent God would be an unjust God, and a cruel God
likewise.&nbsp; If God be just, as He is, then He has boundless 
pity for those who are weak, but boundless wrath for the strong 
who misuse the weak.&nbsp; Boundless pity for those who are 
ignorant, misled, and out of the right way; but boundless wrath 
for those who mislead them and put them out of the right way.</p>

<h3><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>The Fifty-First Psalm.&nbsp; January 22.</h3>
<p>It is such utterances as these which have given for now many 
hundred years their priceless value to the little Book of Psalms 
ascribed to the shepherd outlaw of the Judean hills, which have 
sent the sound of his name into all lands throughout all the 
world.&nbsp; Every form of human sorrow, doubt, struggle, error, 
sin&mdash;the nun agonising in the cloister; the settler 
struggling for his life in Transatlantic forests; the pauper 
shivering over the embers in his hovel and waiting for kind 
death; the man of business striving to keep his honour pure amid 
the temptations of commerce; the prodigal son starving in the far
country and recollecting the words which he learnt long ago at 
his mother&rsquo;s knee; the peasant boy trudging afield in the 
chill dawn and remembering that the Lord is his Shepherd, 
therefore he will not want&mdash;all shapes of humanity have 
found, and will find to the end of time, a word said here to 
their inmost hearts. . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sermons on David</i>.&nbsp;

<h3>Waiting for Death.&nbsp; January 23.</h3>
<p>Death, beautiful, wise, kind Death, when will you come and 
tell me what I want to know?&nbsp; I courted you once and many a 
time, brave old Death, only to give rest to the weary.&nbsp; That
was a coward&rsquo;s wish&mdash;and so you would not come. . . 
.&nbsp; I was not worthy of you.&nbsp; And now I will not hunt 
you any more, old Death.&nbsp; Do you bide your time, and I mine.
. . .&nbsp; Only when you come, give me not rest but work.&nbsp; 
Give work to the idle, freedom to the chained, sight to the 
blind!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Two Years Ago</i>, chap. 
xv.&nbsp; 1856.</p>
<h3>The One Refuge.&nbsp; January 24.</h3>
<p>Safe!&nbsp; There is no safety but from God, and that comes by
prayer and faith.</p>

<h3><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>Future Identity.&nbsp; January 25.</h3>
<p>I believe that the union of those who have loved here will in 
the next world amount to perfect identity, that they will look 
back on the expressions of affection here as mere meagre 
strugglings after and approximation to the union which then will 
be perfect.&nbsp; Perfect!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.&nbsp; 
1842.</p>
<h3>Friendship.&nbsp; January 26.</h3>
<p>A friend once won need never be lost, if we will be only 
trusty and true ourselves.&nbsp; Friends may part, not merely in 
body, but in spirit, for a while.&nbsp; In the bustle of business
and the accidents of life, they may lose sight of each other for 
years; and more, they may begin to differ in their success in 
life, in their opinions, in their habits, and there may be, for a
time, coldness and estrangement between them, but not for ever if
each will be trusty and true.&nbsp; For then they will be like 
two ships who set sail at morning from the same port, and ere 
night-fall lose sight of each other, and go each on its own 
course and at its own pace for many days, through many storms and
seas, and yet meet again, and find themselves lying side by side 
in the same haven when their long voyage is past.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Water of Life Sermons</i>.</p>
<h3>Night and Morning.&nbsp; January 27.</h3>
<p>It is morning somewhere or other now, and it will be morning 
here again to-morrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good times and bad times and 
all times pass over.&rdquo;&nbsp; I learnt that lesson out of old
Bewick&rsquo;s Vignettes, and it has stood me in good stead this 
many a year.</p>

<h3><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>Communion with the Blessed Dead.&nbsp; January 28.</h3>
<p>Shall we not recollect the blessed dead above all in Holy 
Communion, and give thanks for them there&mdash;at that holy 
table at which the Church triumphant and the Church militant meet
in the communion of saints?&nbsp; Where Christ is they are; and, 
therefore, if Christ be there, may not they be there 
likewise?&nbsp; May not they be near us though unseen? like us 
claiming their share in the eternal sacrifice, like us partaking 
of that spiritual body and blood which is as much the life of 
saints in heaven as it is of penitent sinners on earth?&nbsp; May
it not be so?&nbsp; It is a mystery into which we will not look 
too far.&nbsp; But this at least is true, that they are with Him 
where He is.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>MS. Sermon</i>.</p>
<h3>The Great Law.&nbsp; January 29.</h3>
<p>True rest can only be attained as Christ attained it, through 
labour.&nbsp; True glory can only be attained in earth or heaven 
through self-sacrifice.&nbsp; Whosoever will save his life shall 
lose it; whosoever will lose his life shall save it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>All Saints&rsquo; Day

<h3>The Coming Kingdom.&nbsp; January 30.</h3>
<p>There is a God-appointed theocracy promised to us, and which 
we must wait for, when all the diseased and false systems of this
world shall be swept away, and Christ&rsquo;s feet shall stand on
the Mount of Olives, and the twelve apostles shall sit on twelve 
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel!&nbsp; All this shall
come, and blessed is that servant whom his Lord when He cometh 
shall find ready!&nbsp; All this we shall not see before we die, 
but we shall see it when we rise in the perfect material and 
spiritual ideal, in the kingdom of God!</p>

<h3><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>Christ&rsquo;s Coming.&nbsp; January 31.</h3>
<p>Christ may come to us when our thoughts are cleaving to the 
ground, and ready to grow earthy of the earth&mdash;through noble
poetry, noble music, noble art&mdash;through aught which awakens 
once more in us the instinct of the true, the beautiful, and the 
good.&nbsp; He may come to us when our souls are restless and 
weary, through the repose of Nature&mdash;the repose of the 
lonely snow-peak and of the sleeping forest, of the clouds of 
sunset and of the summer sea, and whisper Peace.&nbsp; Or He may 
come, as He comes on winter nights to many a gallant 
soul&mdash;not in the repose of Nature, but in her rage&mdash;in 
howling storm and blinding foam and ruthless rocks and whelming 
surge&mdash;and whisper to them even so&mdash;as the sea swallows
all of them which <i>it</i> can take&mdash;of calm beyond, which 
this world cannot give and cannot take away.</p>
<p>And therefore let us say in utter faith, Come as Thou seest 
best&mdash;but in whatsoever way Thou comest, Even so come, Lord 
Jesus.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

24</span>SAINTS&rsquo; DAYS, FASTS, &amp; FESTIVALS.</h3>
<p>Since we gave up at the Reformation the superstitious practice
of praying to the saints, Saints&rsquo; Days have sunk&mdash;and,
indeed, sunk too much&mdash;into neglect.&nbsp; We forget too 
often still, that though praying to any saint or angel, or other 
created being, is contrary both to reason and Scripture, yet it 
is according to reason and to Scripture to commemorate 
them.&nbsp; That is, to remember them, to study their characters,

The Epiphany,<br />
Manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles.</h4>
<p>On this day the Lord Jesus was first shown to the 
Gentiles.&nbsp; The word Epiphany means 
&ldquo;showing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Wise Men were worshippers of the
true God, though in a dim confused way; and they had learnt 
enough of what true faith, true greatness was, not to be 
staggered and fall into unbelief when they saw the King of the 
Jews laid, not in a palace, but in a manger, tended by a poor 
village maiden.&nbsp; And therefore God bestowed on them the 
great honour that they first of all&mdash;Gentiles&mdash;should 
see the glory and the love of God in the face of Jesus 
Christ.&nbsp; God grant that they may not rise up against us in 
the Day of Judgment and condemn us!&nbsp; They had but a small 
spark, a dim ray, of the Light which lighteth every man who 
cometh into the world; but they were more faithful to that little
than many of us, who live in the full sunshine of the Gospel, 
with Christ&rsquo;s Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s Sacraments, 
Christ&rsquo;s Churches,&mdash;means of grace and hopes of glory 
of which they never dreamed.</p>

Conversion of St. Paul, Apostle and Martyr.</h4>
<p>How did St. Paul look on his past life?&nbsp; There is no 
sentimental melancholy in him.&nbsp; He is saved, and he knows 
it.&nbsp; He is an Apostle, and he stands boldly on his 
dignity.&nbsp; He is cheerful, hopeful, joyful.&nbsp; And yet, 
when he speaks of the past, it is with noble shame and sorrow 
that he calls himself the chief of sinners, not worthy to be 
called an Apostle, because he persecuted the Church of 
Christ.&nbsp; What he is, he will not deny; what he was, he will 
not forget; lest he should forget that in him, that is, in his 
flesh&mdash;his natural character&mdash;dwelleth no good thing; 
lest he should forget that the good which he does, <i>he</i> does
not, but Christ which dwelleth in him; lest he should grow 
careless, puffed up, self-indulgent; lest he should neglect to 
subdue his evil passions; and so, after preaching to others, 
himself become a castaway.</p>

No rational man ever heard a bird sing without feeling that the 
bird was happy, and that if God made that bird He made it to be 
happy, and He takes pleasure in its happiness, though no human 
ear should ever hear its song, no human heart should ever share 
in its joy.</p>

explaining with it a thousand more, connecting them all with each
other and with the mighty whole, till order and meaning shoots 
through some old chaos of scattered observations.&nbsp; Is not

that useless fashion.&nbsp; So she had to earn her wisdom, and to
work hard, and suffer much ere she attained it.&nbsp; And in 
attaining she endured strange adventures and great sorrows; and 
yet they would not have given her the wisdom had she not had 
something in herself which gave her wit to understand her 
lessons, and skill and courage to do what they taught her.&nbsp; 
There had been many names for that something before she was born,
there have been many names for it since, but her father and 
mother called it the Grace of God.</p>

<p>It is the glory of woman that she was sent into the world to

say, let her smallest rights be respected, her smallest wrongs 
redressed; but let her never be persuaded to forget that she is 
sent into the world to teach man&mdash;what I believe she has 
been teaching him all along, even in the savage state, namely, 
that there is something more necessary than the claiming of 
rights, and that is, the performing of duties; to teach him 
specially, in these so-called intellectual days, that there is 
something more than intellect, and that is&mdash;purity and 
virtue.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said, &ldquo;The greater the sinner the 
greater the saint.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not believe it.&nbsp; I do 
not see it.&nbsp; It stands to reason&mdash;if a man loses his 
way and finds it again, he is so much the less forward on his 
way, surely, by all the time he has spent in getting back into 
the way.</p>
<p>And if any of you fancy you can sin without being punished, 
remember that the prodigal son is punished most severely.&nbsp; 
He does not get off freely the moment he chooses to repent, as 
false preachers will tell you.&nbsp; Even after he does repent 
and resolves to go back to his father&rsquo;s house he has a long
journey home in poverty and misery, footsore, hungry, and all but
despairing.&nbsp; But when he does get home; when he shows he has
learnt the bitter lesson; when all he dares to ask is, 
&ldquo;Make me as one of thy hired servants,&rdquo;&mdash;he is 
received as freely as the rest.</p>

<p>In teaching women we must try to make our deepest lessons bear
on the great purpose of unfolding Woman&rsquo;s own calling in 
all ages&mdash;her especial calling in this one.&nbsp; We must 
incite them to realise the chivalrous belief of our old 
forefathers among their Saxon forests, that something Divine 
dwelt in the counsels of woman: but, on the other hand, we must 
continually remind them that they will attain that divine 
instinct, not by renouncing their sex, but by fulfilling it; by 
becoming true women, and not bad imitations of men; by educating 
their heads for the sake of their hearts, not their hearts for 
the sake of their heads; by claiming woman&rsquo;s divine 
vocation as the priestess of purity, of beauty, and of love.</p>

<h3>The Church Catechism.&nbsp; February 29.</h3>
<p>Did it ever strike you that the simple, noble, old Church 
Catechism, without one word about rewards and punishments, heaven
or hell, begins to talk to the child, like a true English 
Catechism as it is, about that glorious old English key-word 
Duty?&nbsp; It calls on the child to confess its own duty, and 
teaches it that its duty is something most human, simple, 
everyday&mdash;commonplace, if you will call it so.&nbsp; And I 
rejoice in the thought that the Church Catechism teaches that the
child&rsquo;s duty is commonplace.&nbsp; I rejoice that in what 
it says about our duty to God and our neighbour, it says not one 
word about counsels of perfection, or those frames and feelings 
which depend, believe me, principally on the state of 
people&rsquo;s bodily health, on the constitution of their 
nerves, and the temper of their brain; but that it requires 
nothing except what a little child can do as well as a grown 
person, a labouring man as well as a divine, a plain farmer as 
well as the most refined, devout, imaginative lady.</p>

<h3>A Charm of Birds.&nbsp; March 2.</h3>
<p>Little do most people know how much there is to 
learn&mdash;what variety of character, as well as variety of 
motion, may be distinguished by the practised ear in a 
&ldquo;charm of birds&rdquo;&mdash;from the wild cry of the 
missel-thrush, ringing from afar in the first bright days of 
March a passage of one or two bars repeated three or four times, 
and then another and another, clear and sweet and yet 
defiant&mdash;for the great &ldquo;storm-cock&rdquo; loves to 
sing when rain and wind is coming on, and faces the elements as 
boldly as he faces hawk and crow&mdash;down to the delicate 
warble of the wren, who slips out of his hole in the brown bank 
where he has huddled through the frost with wife and children, 
all folded in each other&rsquo;s arms like human beings.&nbsp; 
Yet even he, sitting at his house-door in the low sunlight, says 
grace for all mercies in a song so rapid, so shrill, so loud, and
yet so delicately modulated, that you wonder at the amount of 
soul within that tiny body; and then stops suddenly, like a child
that has said its lesson or got to the end of a sermon, gives a 
self-satisfied flirt of his tail, and goes in again to sleep.</p>

<h3>Tact of the Heart.&nbsp; March 3.</h3>

in the whole universe as one infinite complexity of special 
providences.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Letters and Memories</i>.</p>
<p>The grain of dust is a thought of God; God&rsquo;s power made 
it; God&rsquo;s wisdom gave it whatsoever properties or qualities
it may possess.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s providence has put it in the 
place where it is now, and has ordained that it should be in that
place at that moment, by a train of causes and effects which 
reaches back to the very creation of the universe.&nbsp; The 
grain of dust can no more go from God&rsquo;s presence or flee 
from God&rsquo;s Spirit than you or I can.</p>

<h3>Self-sacrifice and Personality.&nbsp; March 6.</h3>
<p>What a strange mystery is that of mutual self-sacrifice! to 
exist for one moment for another! the perfection of human 
bliss!&nbsp; And does not love teach us two things?&nbsp; First, 
that self-sacrifice, the living for others, is the law of our 
perfect being, and next, that by and in self-sacrifice alone can 
we attain to the perfect apprehension of ourselves, our own 
personality, our own duty, our own bliss.&nbsp; So that the 
mystics are utterly wrong when they fancy that self-sacrifice can
be attained by self-annihilation.&nbsp; Self-sacrifice, instead 
of destroying the sense of personality, perfects it.</p>

<p>This is the age of <i>books</i>.&nbsp; And we should reverence

wonderful than a book&mdash;a message to us from the dead, from 
human souls whom we never saw, who lived perhaps thousands of 
miles away, and yet in those little sheets of paper speak to us, 
amuse us, terrify us, teach us, comfort us, open their hearts to 
us as brothers!</p>
<p>We ought to reverence books, to look at them as awful and 
mighty things.&nbsp; If they are good and true, whether they are 
about religion or politics, trade or medicine, they are the 
message of Christ, the Maker of all things, the Teacher of all 
truth, which He has put into the heart of some men to 
speak.&nbsp; And at the last day, be sure of it, we shall have to
render an account&mdash;a strict account&mdash;of the books which
we have read, and of the way in which we have obeyed what we 
read, just as if we had had so many prophets or angels sent to 
us.</p>

<h3>The Unknown Future.&nbsp; March 9.</h3>

<h3>Content or Happy?&nbsp; March 11.</h3>
<p>My friends, whether you will be the happier for any knowledge

cannot tell.&nbsp; That lies in the decision of a higher Power 
than I; and, indeed, to speak honestly, I do not think that any 
branch of physical science is likely, at first at least, to make 
you happy.&nbsp; Neither is the study of your fellow-men.&nbsp; 
Neither is religion itself.&nbsp; We were not sent into the world
to be happy, but to be right&mdash;at least, poor creatures that 
we are&mdash;as right as we can be, and we must be content with 
being right, and not happy. . . .&nbsp; And we shall be made 
truly wise if we be made content; content, too, not only with 
what we can understand, but content with what we do not 
understand&mdash;the habit of mind which theologians call (and 
rightly) faith in God, true and solid faith, which comes often 
out of sadness and out of doubt.</p>

counsel and reproof in the days of prosperity and self-conceit; 
but who, again, will comfort and encourage us in the day of

deducing the fundamental laws of his subject, obey them 
whithersoever they may lead; but who picks and chooses out of 
them just so many as may be pleasant to his private taste, and

ideas of Nature in proportion to the number of facts which he has
determined to discard.</p>

<h3>Ancient Greek Education, March 23.</h3>
<p>We talk of education now.&nbsp; Are we more educated than were

have not taught us at least the rudiments?&nbsp; Are there not 
some branches of education which they perfected once and for 
ever, leaving us northern barbarians to follow or not to follow 
their example?&nbsp; To produce health, that is, harmony and 
sympathy, proportion and grace, in every faculty of mind and 
body&mdash;that was their notion of education.</p>
<p>Ah! the waste of health and strength in the young!&nbsp; The 
waste, too, of anxiety and misery in those who love and tend 
them!&nbsp; How much of it might be saved by a little rational 
education in those laws of nature which are the will of God about
the welfare of our bodies, and which, therefore, we are as much 
bound to know and to obey as we are bound to know and to obey the
spiritual laws whereon depend the welfare of our souls.</p>

<h4>MARCH 25.<br />
The Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin,<br />
<span class="smcap">commonly called</span><br />
Lady Day.</h4>
<p>It is one of the glories of our holy religion, and one of the 
ways by which the Gospel takes such hold on our hearts, that, 
mixed up with the grandest and most mysterious and most divine 
matters, are the simplest, the most tender, the most human.&nbsp;
What more grand, or deep, or divine words can we say than, 
&ldquo;I believe in Jesus Christ, God&rsquo;s only Son our Lord, 
who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,&rdquo;&mdash;and yet what 
more simple, human, and tender words can we say than, &ldquo;Who 
was born of the Virgin Mary&rdquo;?&nbsp; For what more beautiful
sight on earth than a young mother with her babe upon her 
knee?&nbsp; Beautiful in itself; but doubly beautiful to those 
who can say, &ldquo;I believe in Him who was born of the Virgin 
Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For since He was born of woman, and thereby took the manhood 
into God, birth is holy, and childhood holy, and all a 
mother&rsquo;s joys and a mother&rsquo;s cares are holy to the 
Lord; and every Christian mother with her babe in her arms is a 
token and a sign from God, a pledge of His good-will towards men,
a type and pattern of her who was highly-favoured and blessed 
above all women.&nbsp; Everything has its time, and Lady-Day is 
the time for our remembering the Blessed Virgin.&nbsp; For our 
hearts and reasons tell us (and have told all Christians in all 
ages), that she must have been holier, nobler, fairer in body and
soul, than all women upon earth.</p>

<h3>High Ideals.&nbsp; April 3.</h3>
<p>What if a man&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; be 
somewhat too narrow for the year of grace 18--, is it no honour 
to him that he has such an idea at all? that there has risen up 
before him the vision of a perfect polity, a &ldquo;divine and 
wonderful order,&rdquo; linking earth to heaven, and to the very 
throne of Him who died for men; witnessing to each of its 
citizens what the world tries to make him forget, namely, that he
is the child of God Himself; and guiding and strengthening him 
from the cradle to the grave to do his Father&rsquo;s work?&nbsp;
Is it no honour to him that he has seen that such a polity must 
exist, that he believes that it does exist, or that he thinks he 
finds it in its highest, if not in its most perfect form, in the 
most ancient and august traditions of his native land?&nbsp; 
True, he may have much still to learn. . . .</p>

<p>That glorious word <i>know</i>&mdash;it is God&rsquo;s 
attribute, and includes in itself all others.&nbsp; Love, 
truth&mdash;all are parts of that awful power of <i>knowing</i> 
at a single glance, from and to all eternity, what a thing is in 
its essence, its properties, and its relations to the whole 
universe through all Time.&nbsp; I feel awestruck whenever I see 
that word used rightly, and I never, if I can remember, use it 
myself of myself.</p>

<h3>Woman&rsquo;s Love.&nbsp; April 5.</h3>
<p>The story of Ruth is the consecration of woman&rsquo;s 
love.&nbsp; I do not mean of the love of wife to husband, divine 
and blessed as that is.&nbsp; I mean that depth and strength of 
devotion, tenderness, and self-sacrifice, which God has put into 
the heart of all true women; and which they spend so strangely, 
and so nobly often, on persons who have no claim on them, and 
from whom they can receive no earthly reward&mdash;the affection 
which made women minister of their substance to our Lord Jesus 
Christ, which brought Mary Magdalene to the foot of the cross and
to the door of the tomb&mdash;the affection which made a wise man
say that as long as women and sorrow are left in the world, so 
long will the gospel of our Lord Jesus live and conquer 
therein.</p>

<h3>Feeling and Emotion.&nbsp; April 6.</h3>
<p>Live a life of <i>feeling</i>, not of <i>excitement</i>.&nbsp;
Let your religion, your duties, every thought and word, be ruled 
by the <i>affections</i>, not by the <i>emotions</i>, which are 
the expressions of them.&nbsp; Do not consider whether you are 
glad, sorry, dull, or spiritual at any moment, but be 
yourself&mdash;what God makes you.</p>

<p>St. Paul says that he himself saw through a glass 
darkly.&nbsp; But this he seems to have seen, that the Lord, when
He rose from the dead, brought a blessing even for the dumb 
beasts and the earth on which we live.&nbsp; He says the whole 
creation is now groaning in the pangs of labour, about to bring 
forth something, and that the whole creation will rise 
again&mdash;how and when and into what new state we cannot tell; 
but that when the Lord shall destroy death the whole creation 
shall be renewed.</p>

<h3>Reverence for Age.&nbsp; April 8.</h3>
<p>Reverence for age is a fair test of the vigour of youth; and, 
conversely, insolence towards the old and the past, whether in 
individuals or in nations, is a sign rather of weakness than of 
strength.</p>

<h3>Prayers for the Dead.&nbsp; April 9.</h3>
<p>We do not in the Church of England now pray for the 
dead.&nbsp; We are not absolutely forbidden by Scripture to do 
so.&nbsp; But we believe they are where they ought to 
be&mdash;that they are gone to a perfectly just world, in which 
is none of the confusion, mistakes, wrong, and oppression of this
world; in which they will therefore receive the due reward of 
their deeds done in the body; and that they are in the hands of a
perfectly just God, who rewardeth every man according to his 
work.&nbsp; It seems therefore unnecessary, and, so to speak, an 
impertinence towards God, to pray for them who are in the unseen 
world of spirits exactly in the state which they have 
deserved.</p>

He died thou canst see at the first glance, if thou hast a human

<i>Love</i>&mdash;love itself, love boundless, unconquerable, 
unchangeable&mdash;love which inhabits eternity, and therefore 
could not be hardened or foiled by any sin or rebellion of man, 
but must love men still&mdash;must go out to seek and save them, 
must dare, suffer any misery, shame, death itself, for their 
sake&mdash;just because it is absolute and perfect Love which 
inhabits eternity.</p>

<p>A well-educated moral sense, a well-educated character, saves

<h3>Women and Novels.&nbsp; April 14.</h3>
<p>Novels will be read; but that is all the more reason why women
should be trained, by the perusal of a higher, broader, deeper

from the immoral, the noble from the base, the true work of art 
from the sham which hides its shallowness and vulgarity under a 
tangled plot and a melodramatic situation.&nbsp; They should 
learn&mdash;and that they can only learn by cultivation&mdash;to 
discern with joy and drink in with reverence, the good, the 
beautiful, and the true, and to turn with the fine scorn of a 
pure and strong womanhood from the bad, the ugly, and the 
false.</p>

him, and was helping him in the daily business of life: that it 
was worth while asking that Being&rsquo;s advice, or that any 
advice would be given if asked for&mdash;of any practical notion 
of a heavenly Father or a Divine educator&mdash;he was as

that honour must grow out of humility; that freedom must grow out
of discipline; that sure conquest must be born of heavy 
struggles; righteous joy out of righteous sorrow; pure laughter 
out of pure tears; true strength out of the true knowledge of our
own weakness; sound peace of mind out of sound contrition.</p>

why?&nbsp; Because they are gone to the Father, to the Source and
Fount of all life and power, all light and love, that they may 
gain life from His life, power from His power, light from His 
light, love from His love; and surely not for nought.&nbsp; 
Surely not for nought.&nbsp; For if they were like Christ on 
earth, and did not use their powers for themselves alone; if they
are to be like Christ when they see Him as He is, then, more

Christ uses His, for those they love.</p>

<p>From the earliest times the Cross has been the special sign of
Christians.&nbsp; St. Paul tells us his great hope, his great 
business, what God had sent him into the world to do, was 
this&mdash;to make people know the love of Christ; to look at 
Christ&rsquo;s Cross, and take in its breadth and length and 
depth and height.</p>
<p>And what is the <i>breadth</i> of Christ&rsquo;s Cross?&nbsp; 
My friends, it is as broad as the whole world, for He died for 
the whole world; as it is written, &ldquo;He is a propitiation 
not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole 
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that is the <i>breadth</i> of 
Christ&rsquo;s Cross.</p>
<p>And what is the <i>length</i> of Christ&rsquo;s Cross?&nbsp; 
Long enough to last through all time.&nbsp; As long as there is a
sinner to be saved; as long as there is ignorance, sorrow, pain, 
death, or anything else which is contrary to God and hurtful to 
man in the universe of God, so long will Christ&rsquo;s Cross 
last.&nbsp; And that is the <i>length</i> of the Cross of 
Christ.</p>
<p>And how <i>high</i> is Christ&rsquo;s Cross?&nbsp; As high as 
the highest heaven, and the throne of God and the bosom of the 
Father&mdash;that bosom out of which for ever proceed all created
things.&nbsp; Ay, as high as the highest heaven; for, if you will
receive it, when Christ hung upon the Cross heaven came down on 
earth, and earth ascended into heaven.&nbsp; And that is the 
<i>height</i> of the Cross of Christ.</p>
<p>And how <i>deep</i> is the Cross of Christ?&nbsp; This is a 
great mystery which people are afraid to look into, and darken it
of their own will.&nbsp; But if the Cross of Christ be as high as
heaven, then it must be as deep as hell, deep enough to reach the
deepest sinner in the deepest pit to which he may fall, for 
Christ descended into hell, and preached to the spirits in 
prison.&nbsp; Let us hope, then, that is the <i>depth</i> of the 
Cross of Christ.</p>

<p>Is it merely a fancy that we are losing that love for Spring 
which among our old forefathers rose almost to worship?&nbsp; 
That the perpetual miracle of the budding leaves and the 
returning song-birds awakes no longer in us the astonishment 
which it awoke yearly among the dwellers in the old world, when 
the sun was a god who was sick to death each winter, and returned
in spring to life, and health, and glory; when Freya, the goddess
of youth and love, went forth over the earth while the flowers 
broke forth under her tread over the brown moors, and the birds 
welcomed her with song?&nbsp; To those simpler children of a 
simpler age winter and spring were the two great facts of 
existence; the symbols, the one of death, the other of life; and 
the battle between the two&mdash;the battle of the sun with 
darkness, of winter with spring, of death with life, of

<p>Look at those thousand birds, and without our Father not one 
of them shall fall to the ground; and art thou not of more value 
than many sparrows&mdash;thou for whom God sent His Son to die? .
. .&nbsp; Ah! my friend, we must look out and around to see what 
God is like.&nbsp; It is when we persist in turning our eyes 
inward, and prying curiously over our own imperfections, that we 
learn to make a god after our own image, and fancy that our own 
hardness and darkness are the patterns of His light and love.</p>

<h3>Want of Sympathy.&nbsp; May 5.</h3>
<p>If we do not understand our fellow-creatures we shall never 
love them.&nbsp; And it is equally true, that if we do not love 
them we shall never understand them.&nbsp; Want of charity, want 
of sympathy, want of good feeling and fellow-feeling&mdash;what 
does it, what can it breed but endless mistakes and ignorances, 
both of men&rsquo;s characters and men&rsquo;s circumstances?</p>

<h3>A Religion.&nbsp; May 6.</h3>
<p>If all that a man wants is &ldquo;a <i>religion</i>,&rdquo; he
ought to be able to make a very pretty one for himself, and a 
fresh one as often as he is tired of the old.&nbsp; But the heart
and soul of man wants more than that; as it is written, &ldquo;My
soul is athirst for <span class="smcap">God</span>, even for the 
living God.&rdquo;&nbsp; I want a living God, who cares for men, 
forgives men, saves men from their sins: and Him I have found in 
the Bible, and nowhere else, save in the facts of life which the 
Bible alone interprets.</p>

<h3>Nature and Grace.&nbsp; May 8.</h3>
<p>Why speak of the God of Nature and the God of grace as two 
antithetical terms?&nbsp; The Bible never in a single instance 
makes the distinction, and surely if God be the eternal and 
unchangeable One, and if all the universe bears the impress of 
His signet, we have no right, in the present infantile state of 
science, to put arbitrary limits of our own to the revelation 
which He may have thought good to make of Himself in 
Nature.&nbsp; Nay, rather, let us believe that if our eyes were 
opened we should fulfil the requirement of genius and see the 
universal in the particular by seeing God&rsquo;s whole likeness,
His whole glory, reflected as in a mirror in the meanest flower, 
and that nothing but the dulness of our simple souls prevents 
them from seeing day and night in all things the Lord Jesus 
Christ fulfilling His own saying, &ldquo;My Father worketh 
hitherto, and I work.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Wisdom the Child of Goodness.&nbsp; May 9.</h3>
<p>Goodness rather than talent had given her a wisdom, and

<h3>Music the Speech of God.&nbsp; May 11.</h3>
<p>Music&mdash;there is something very wonderful in music.&nbsp; 
Words are wonderful enough, but music is more wonderful.&nbsp; It
speaks not to our thoughts as words do, it speaks straight to our
hearts and spirits, to the very core and root of our souls.&nbsp;
Music soothes us, stirs us up; it puts noble feelings into us; it
melts us to tears, we know not how; it is a language by itself, 
just as perfect, in its way, as speech, as words; just as divine,
just as blessed.&nbsp; Music has been called the speech of 
angels; I will go farther, and call it the speech of God 
Himself.</p>
<p>The old Greeks, the wisest of all the heathen, made a point of
teaching their children music, because, they said, it taught them
not to be self-willed and fanciful, but to see the beauty of 
order, the usefulness of rule, the divineness of law.</p>

<h3>Facing Realities.&nbsp; May 12.</h3>
<p>The only comfort I can see in the tragedies of war is that 
they bring us all face to face with the realities of human life, 
as it has been in all ages, giving us sterner and yet more 
loving, more human, and more divine thoughts about ourselves, and
our business here, and the fate of those who are gone, and 
awakening us out of the luxurious, frivolous, and unreal dream 
(full nevertheless of hard judgments) in which we have been 
living so long, to trust in a living Father who is really and 
practically governing this world and all worlds, and who willeth 
that none should perish.</p>

England to see how we, with all our boast of civilisation, are 
yet but one step removed from barbarism.&nbsp; Is that a hard 
word?&nbsp; Only there <i>are</i> the barbarians round us at 
every street corner&mdash;grown barbarians, it may be, now all 
but past saving, but bringing into the world young barbarians 
whom we may yet save, for God wishes us to save them. . . .&nbsp;
Do not deceive yourselves about the little dirty, offensive 
children in the street.&nbsp; If they be offensive to you, they 
are not to Him who made them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take heed that ye 
despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, their 
angels do always behold the face of your Father which is in

<h3>Heaven and Hell.&nbsp; May 15.</h3>
<p>Heaven and hell&mdash;the spiritual world&mdash;are they 
merely invisible places in space which may become visible 
hereafter? or are they not rather the moral world of right and 
wrong?&nbsp; Love and righteousness&mdash;is not that the heaven 
itself wherein God dwells?&nbsp; Hatred and sin&mdash;is not that
hell itself, wherein dwells all that is opposed to God?</p>

<p>Our hearts are dull, and hard, and light, God forgive us! and 
we forget continually what an earnest, awful world we live 
in&mdash;a whole eternity waiting for us to be born, and a whole 
eternity waiting to see what we shall do now we are born.&nbsp; 
Yes, our hearts are dull, and hard, and light.&nbsp; And 
therefore Christ sends suffering on us, to teach us what we 
always gladly forget in comfort and prosperity&mdash;what an 
awful capacity of suffering we have; and more, what an awful 
capacity of suffering our fellow-creatures have likewise. . . 
.</p>
<p>We sit at ease too often in a fool&rsquo;s paradise, till God 
awakens us and tortures us into pity for the torture of 
others.&nbsp; And so, if we will not acknowledge our brotherhood 
by any other teaching, He knits us together by the brotherhood of
suffering.</p>

<h3>Cry of the Heart and Reason.&nbsp; May 18.</h3>
<p>A living God, a true God, a real God, a God worthy of the 
name, a God who is working for ever, everywhere, and in all; who 
hates nothing that He has made, forgets nothing, neglects 
nothing; a God who satisfies not only the head but the heart, not
only the logical intellect but the highest reason&mdash;that pure
reason which is one with the conscience and moral sense!&nbsp; 
For Him we cry out, Him we seek, and if we cannot find Him we

<p>Whenever we are tempted to say more than is needful, let us 
remember St. John&rsquo;s words (in the only sermon we have on 
record of his), &ldquo;Little children, love one another,&rdquo; 
and ask God for His Holy Spirit, the spirit of love, which, 
instead of weakening a man&rsquo;s words, makes them all the 
stronger in the cause of truth, because they are spoken in 
love.</p>

And have no time for self-deception.</p>

<h3>Death and Everlasting Life.&nbsp; May 21.</h3>
<p>Do not rashly count on some sudden radical change happening to
you as soon as you die to make you fit for heaven.&nbsp; There is
not one word in the Bible which gives us reason to suppose that 
we shall not be in the next world the same persons that we have 
made ourselves in this world. . . .&nbsp; What we sow here we 
shall reap there.&nbsp; And it is good for us to know and face 
this.&nbsp; Anything is good for us, however unpleasant it may 
be, which drives us from the only real misery, which is sin and 
selfishness, to the only true happiness, which is the everlasting
life of Christ, a pure, loving, just, generous, useful life of 
goodness.</p>

<p>Science is great; but she is not the greatest.&nbsp; She is an
instrument and not a power&mdash;beneficent or deadly, according 
as she is wielded by the hand of virtue or vice.&nbsp; But her 
lawful mistress, the only one which can use her aright, the only 
one under whom she can truly grow and prosper and prove her 
divine descent, is Virtue, the likeness of Almighty God.</p>

<h3>A Child&rsquo;s Heart.&nbsp; May 23.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I saw at last!&nbsp; I found out that I had been trying
for years which was stronger, God or I; I found out I had been 
trying whether I could not do well enough without Him; and there 
I found that I could not&mdash;could not!&nbsp; I felt like a 
child who had marched off from home, fancying it can find its 
way, and is lost at once.&nbsp; I did not know that I had a 
Father in heaven who had been looking after me, when I fancied I 
was looking after myself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t half believe it 
now.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; And so the old heart passed away from 
Thomas Thurnall, and instead of it grew up the heart of a little 
child.</p>

<h3>Self-Security.&nbsp; May 24.</h3>
<p>Strange it is how mortal man, &ldquo;who cometh up and is cut

security, and count on the morrow which may never come.&nbsp; Yet
so it is, and perhaps if it were not so no work would get done on

disharmony with that law, which we call unspirituality, was not 
being vulgar, or clumsy, or ill-taught, or unimaginative, or 
dull; but simply being unrighteous? that righteousness, and it

<h3>Human and Divine Love.&nbsp; May 27.</h3>
<p>Believe me that he who has been led by love to a human being 
to understand the mystery of that divine love which fills all 
heaven and earth, and concentrates itself into an articulate 
manifestation in the person of Christ, will soon begin to find 
that he cannot enter into the perfect bliss of that truth without
going further, and seeing that the human heart requires some 
standing-ground for its affection, even for the love of wife and 
child, deeper and surer than that love, namely, in utter loyalty,
resignation, adoring affection to Him in whom all loveliness is 
concentrated.&nbsp; It is a great mystery.&nbsp; It is a hard 
lesson.</p>

the mere pleasure it gives.&nbsp; There is something sacramental 
in perfect metre and rhythm.&nbsp; They are outward and visible 
signs (most seriously we speak as we say it) of an inward and 
spiritual grace, namely, of the self-possessed and victorious 
temper of one who has so far subdued nature as to be able to hear
that universal sphere-music of hers, speaking of which Mr.

<p>There can be no objection to praying for certain special

than a child in the dark can help calling for its mother.&nbsp; 
Only it seems to me that when we pray, &ldquo;Grant this day that
we run into no kind of danger,&rdquo; we ought to lay our stress 
on the &ldquo;run&rdquo; rather than on the &ldquo;danger,&rdquo;
to ask God not to take away the danger by altering the course of 
nature, but to give us light and guidance whereby to avoid 
it.</p>

<p>Look at the rows of vines, or what will be vines when the

sees that sight may find a new beauty and meaning in the mystic 
words, &ldquo;I am the Vine, ye are the branches.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is not merely the connection between branch and stem common to 
all trees; not merely the exhilarating and seemingly inspiring 
properties of the grape, which made the very heathen look upon it
as the sacred and miraculous fruit, the special gift of God; not 
merely the pruning out of the unfruitful branches, to be burned 
as firewood&mdash;not merely these, but the seeming death of the 
Vine, shorn of all its beauty, its fruitfulness, of every branch 
and twig which it had borne the year before, and left unsightly 
and seemingly ruined, to its winter sleep; and then bursting 
forth again by an irresistible inward life into fresh branches, 
spreading and trailing far and wide, and tossing their golden 
tendrils to the sky.&nbsp; This thought surely&mdash;the emblem 
of the living Church, springing from the corpse of the dead 
Christ, who yet should rise to be alive for evermore&mdash;enters
into, it may be forms an integral part of, the meaning of that

<p>The secret of thrift is knowledge.&nbsp; The more you know the
more you can save yourself and that which belongs to you, and can
do more work with less effort.&nbsp; Knowledge of domestic 
economy saves income; knowledge of sanitary laws saves health and
life: knowledge of the laws of the intellect saves wear and tear 
of brain, and knowledge of the laws of the spirit&mdash;what does
it not save?</p>

<h3>Out-door Worship.&nbsp; June 8.</h3>
<p>In the forest, every branch and leaf, with the thousand living
things which cluster on them, all worship, worship, worship with 
us!&nbsp; Let us go up in the evenings and pray there, with 
nothing but God&rsquo;s cloud temple between us and His 
heaven!&nbsp; And His choir of small birds and night crickets and
booming beetles, and all happy things who praise Him all night 
long!&nbsp; And in the still summer noon, too, with the 
lazy-paced clouds above, and the distant sheep-bell, and the bee 
humming in the beds of thyme, and one bird making the hollies 
ring a moment, and then all still&mdash;hushed&mdash;awe-bound, 
as the great thunder-clouds slide up from the far south!&nbsp; 
Then, then, to praise God!&nbsp; Ay, even when the heaven is 
black with wind, the thunder crackling over our heads, then to 
join in the p&aelig;an of the storm-spirits to Him whose pageant 
of power passes over the earth and harms us not in its mercy!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is uncertain,&rdquo; folks say.&nbsp; Life is 
certain, say I, because God is educating us thereby.&nbsp; But 
this process of education is so far above our sight that it looks
often uncertain and utterly lawless; wherefore fools conceive (as
does M. Comte) that there is no Living God, because they cannot 
condense His formulas into their small smelling-bottles.</p>
<p>O glorious thought! that we are under a Father&rsquo;s 
education, and that <i>He</i> has promised to develop us, and to 
make us go on from strength to strength.</p>

<h3>Sensuality.&nbsp; June 11.</h3>

<h3>The Journey&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; June 12.</h3>
<p>Let us live hard, work hard, go a good pace, get to our 
journey&rsquo;s end as soon as possible&mdash;then let the 
post-horse get his shoulder out of the collar. . . . I have lived
long enough to feel, like the old post-horse, very thankful as 
the end draws near. . . .&nbsp; Long life is the last thing that 
I desire.&nbsp; It may be that, as one grows older, one acquires 
more and more the painful consciousness of the difference between
what <i>ought</i> to be done and what <i>can</i> be done, and 
sits down more quietly when one gets the wrong side of fifty, to 
let others start up to do for us things we cannot do for 
ourselves.&nbsp; But it is the highest pleasure that a man can 
have who has (to his own exceeding comfort) turned down the hill 
at last, to believe that younger spirits will rise up after him, 
and catch the lamp of Truth, as in the old lamp-bearing race of 
Greece, out of his hand before it expires, and carry it on to the
goal with swifter and more even feet.</p>

<p>It is a fact that God does punish here, in this life.&nbsp; He
does not, as false preachers say, give over this life to impunity
and this world to the devil, and only resume the reigns of moral 
government and the right of retribution when men die and go into 
the next world.&nbsp; Here in this life He punishes sin.&nbsp; 
Slowly but surely God punishes.&nbsp; If any of you doubt my 
words you have only to commit sin and then see whether your sin 
will find you out.</p>

<h3>The Father&rsquo;s Education.&nbsp; June 15.</h3>
<p>Sin, &alpha;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&iota;&alpha;, is the missing
of a mark, the falling short of an ideal; . . . and that each 
miss brings a penalty, or rather is itself the penalty, is to me 
the best of news and gives me hope for myself and every human 
being past, present, and future, for it makes me look on them all
as children under a paternal education, who are being taught to 
become aware of, and use their own powers in God&rsquo;s house, 
the universe, and for God&rsquo;s work in it; and, in proportion 
as they do that, they attain salvation, 
&sigma;&omega;&tau;&eta;&rho;&iota;&alpha;, literally health and 
wholeness of spirit, &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; which is, like health of
body, its own reward.</p>

<h3>A Charm of Birds.&nbsp; June 17.</h3>
<p>Listen to the charm of birds in any sequestered woodland on a 
bright forenoon in early summer.&nbsp; As you try to disentangle 
the medley of sounds, the first, perhaps, which will strike your 
ear will be the loud, harsh, monotonous, flippant song of the 
chaffinch, and the metallic clinking of two or three sorts of 
titmice.&nbsp; But above the tree-tops, rising, hovering, 
sinking, the woodlark is fluting tender and low.&nbsp; Above the 
pastures outside the skylark sings&mdash;as he alone can sing; 
and close by from the hollies rings out the blackbird&rsquo;s 
tenor&mdash;rollicking, audacious, humorous, all but 
articulate.&nbsp; From the tree above him rises the treble of the
thrush, pure as the song of angels; more pure, perhaps, in tone, 
though neither so varied nor so rich as the song of the 
nightingale.&nbsp; And there, in the next holly, is the 
nightingale himself; now croaking like a frog, now talking aside 
to his wife, and now bursting out into that song, or cycle of 
songs, in which if any man find sorrow, he himself surely finds 
none. . . . In Nature there is nothing melancholy.</p>

<h3>Silent Influence.&nbsp; June 20.</h3>
<p>Violence is not strength, noisiness is not earnestness.&nbsp; 
Noise is a sign of want of faith, and violence is a sign of 
weakness.</p>
<p>By quiet, modest, silent, private influence we shall 
win.&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither strive nor cry nor let your voice be 
heard in the streets,&rdquo; was good advice of old, and is 
still.&nbsp; I have seen many a movement succeed by it.&nbsp; I 
have seen many a movement tried by the other method of striving 
and crying and making a noise in the streets, but I have never 
seen one succeed thereby, and never shall.</p>

<h3>Chivalry.&nbsp; June 21.</h3>
<p>Some say that the age of chivalry is past.&nbsp; The age of 
chivalry is never past as long as there is a wrong left 
unredressed on earth, and a man or woman left to say, &ldquo;I 
will redress that wrong, or spend my life in the 
attempt.&rdquo;&nbsp; The age of chivalry is never past as long 
as men have faith enough in God to say, &ldquo;God will help me 
to redress that wrong; or if not me, surely He will help those 
that come after me.&nbsp; For His eternal will is to overcome 
evil with good.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Simple and Sincere.&nbsp; June 23.</h3>
<p>There are those, and, thanks to Almighty God, they are to be 
numbered by tens of thousands, who will not perplex themselves 
with questionings; simple, genial hearts, who try to do what good
they can in the world, and meddle not with matters too high for 
them; people whose religion is not abstruse but deep, not noisy 
but intense, not aggressive but laboriously useful; people who 
have the same habit of mind as the early Christians seem to have 
worn, ere yet Catholic truth had been defined in formul&aelig;, 
when the Apostles&rsquo; Creed was symbol enough for the Church, 
and men were orthodox in heart rather than exact in head.</p>
<p>For such it is enough if a fellow-creature loves Him whom they
love, and serves Him whom they serve.&nbsp; Personal affection 
and loyalty to the same unseen Being is to them a communion of 
saints both real and actual, in the genial warmth of which all 
minor differences of opinion vanish. . . .</p>

<h3>God&rsquo;s Words.&nbsp; June 24.</h3>

<h3>Presentiments.&nbsp; June 26.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot deny,&rdquo; said Claude, &ldquo;that such 
things as presentiments may be possible.&nbsp; However miraculous
they may seem, are they so very much more so than the daily fact 
of memory?&nbsp; I can as little guess why we remember the past, 
as why we may not at times be able to foresee the future.&rdquo; 
. . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Two Years Ago</i>, chap.

<p>A thing need not be unreasonable&mdash;that is, contrary to 
reason&mdash;because it is above and beyond reason, or, at least,
our human reason, which at best (as St. Paul says) sees as in a 
glass darkly.</p>

<h3>Common Duties.&nbsp; June 27.</h3>
<p>But after all, what is speculation to practice?&nbsp; What

walk humbly with Him?&nbsp; The longer I live this seems to me 
more important, and all other questions less so&mdash;if we can 
but live the simple right life&mdash;</p>

<h3>How to bear Sorrow.&nbsp; June 29.</h3>
<p>I believe that the wisest plan is sometimes not to try to bear
sorrow&mdash;as long as one is not crippled for one&rsquo;s 
everyday duties&mdash;but to give way to it utterly and 
freely.&nbsp; Perhaps sorrow is sent that we <i>may</i> give way 
to it, and in drinking the cup to the dregs, find some medicine 
in it itself, which we should not find if we began doctoring 
ourselves, or letting others doctor us.&nbsp; If we say simply, 
&ldquo;I am wretched&mdash;I ought to be wretched;&rdquo; then we
shall perhaps hear a voice, &ldquo;Who made thee wretched but 
God?&nbsp; Then what can He mean but thy good?&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
if the heart answers impatiently, &ldquo;My good?&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t want it, I want my love;&rdquo; perhaps the voice may
answer, &ldquo;Then thou shalt have both in time.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A certain Hope.&nbsp; June 30.</h3>
<p>Let us look forward with quiet certainty of hope, day and 
night; believing, though we can see but little day, that all this
tangled web will resolve itself into golden threads of twined, 
harmonious life, guiding both us, and those we love, together, 
through this life to that resurrection of the flesh, when we 
shall at last know the reality and the fulness of life and 
love.&nbsp; Even so come, Lord Jesus!</p>

Great painters have exercised their fancy upon his face, his

half clad in his camel&rsquo;s-hair robe, his stalwart hand 
lifted up to denounce he hardly knows what, save that things are 
going all wrong, utterly wrong to him&mdash;his beautiful mouth 
open to preach he hardly knows what, save that he has a message 
from God, of which he is half conscious as yet&mdash;that he is a
forerunner, a prophet, a foreteller of something and some one who
is to come, and which is very near at hand.&nbsp; The wild rocks 
are round him, the clear sky over him, and nothing more, . . . 
and he, the noble and the priest, has thrown off&mdash;not in 
discontent and desperation (for he was neither democrat nor 
vulgar demagogue), but in hope and awe&mdash;all his family 
privileges, all that seems to make life worth having; and there 
aloft and in the mountains, alone with God and Nature, feeding on
locusts and wild honey and clothed in skins, he, like Elijah of 
old, preaches to a generation sunk in covetousness, party spirit,
and superstition&mdash;preaches what?&mdash;The most 
common&mdash;Morality.&nbsp; Ah, wise politician! ah, clear and 
rational spirit, who knows and tells others to do the duty which 
lies nearest to them! . . . who in the hour of his

<p>It was a day of God.&nbsp; The earth lay like one great 
emerald, ringed and roofed with sapphire: blue sea, blue 
mountain, blue sky overhead.&nbsp; There she lay, not sleeping, 
but basking in her quiet Sabbath joy, as though her two great 
sisters of the sea and air had washed her weary limbs with holy 
tears, and purged away the stains of last week&rsquo;s sin and 
toil, and cooled her hot worn forehead with their pure 
incense-breath, and folded her within their azure robes, and 
brooded over her with smiles of pitying love, till she smiled 
back in answer, and took heart and hope for next week&rsquo;s 
weary work.</p>
<p>Heart and hope for next week&rsquo;s work.&mdash;That was the 
sermon which it preached to Tom Thurnall, as he stood there 
alone, a stranger and a wanderer like Ulysses of old: but, like 
him, self-helpful, cheerful, fate defiant.&nbsp; He was more of a
heathen than Ulysses&mdash;for he knew not what Ulysses knew, 
that a heavenly guide was with him in his wanderings; still less 
that what he called the malicious sport of fortune was, in truth,
the earnest education of a Father. . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Brave old 
world she is after all,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and right well 
made; and looks right well to-day in her go-to-meeting clothes,

For ever He looks down on all things which He has made; and

to Him in our churches the most perfect works of naturalistic 
art, and shape them into copies of whatever beauty He has shown 
us in man or woman, in cave or mountain-peak, in tree or flower, 
even in bird or butterfly.&nbsp; But Himself?&nbsp; Who can see 
Him except the humble and the contrite heart, to whom He reveals 
Himself as a Spirit to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and

Christianity has never yet been pure, because it never yet, since

<p>Study the human figure, both as intrinsically beautiful and as
expressing mind.&nbsp; It only expresses the broad natural 
childish emotions, which are just what we want to return to from 
our over subtlety.&nbsp; Study &ldquo;natural

is an inexhaustible source of knowledge and delight, and enables 
one human being to understand another so perfectly.&nbsp;

&ldquo;Wash you, make you clean, saith the Lord.&nbsp; Do justice
to the fatherless, relieve the widow.&rdquo;&nbsp;

<p>It is easy to see the spiritual beauty of Raffaelle&rsquo;s

about the price of cottons.</p>
<p>Form and colour are but the vehicle for the

makes the whole world one mass of special Providences, every sin 
of ours will punish itself, and probably punish itself in

the one making the existence of the other necessary, explaining 
each other, and giving each other a real standing ground and 
equilibrium.&nbsp; Such an antinomic pair are, &ldquo;He that 
loveth not knoweth not God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;If a man hateth not
his father and mother he cannot be My disciple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some quick music is inexpressibly mournful.&nbsp; It seems

with the remembrance of past sorrow wailing up, yet without

present joy; and the notes seem thoughts&mdash;thoughts pure of 
words; and a spirit seems to call to me in them and cry, 
&ldquo;Hast thou not felt all this?&rdquo;&nbsp; And I start when
I find myself answering unconsciously, &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know it
all!&nbsp; Surely we are a part of all we see and 
hear!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, the harmony thickens, and all 
distinct sound is pressed together and absorbed in a confused 
paroxysm of delight, where still the female treble and the male 
bass are distinct for a moment, and then one again&mdash;absorbed
into each other&rsquo;s being&mdash;sweetened and strengthened by
each other&rsquo;s melody. . . .</p>

that he is at home; that he has roots deep and wide struck down

cruel or useless can tear them up.&nbsp; It is pleasant to look 
down on the same parish day after day, and say I know all that is

<p>Over the greater part of the so-called civilised world is

human nature which you do not see.&nbsp; Such a temper of mind, 
unless it be checked by that which alone can check it, namely, 
the grace of God, must tend towards sheer anarchy.&nbsp; There is
a deeper and uglier anarchy than any mere political 
anarchy,&mdash;which the abuse of the critical spirit leads 
to,&mdash;the anarchy of society and of the family, the anarchy 
of the head and of the heart, which leaves poor human beings as

merely some sort of chrysalis state in which man&rsquo;s

<h3>God waits for Man.&nbsp; August 12.</h3>
<p>Patiently, nobly, magnanimously, God waits; waits for the man

that everything else disappoints, and to come back to Him, the 
fountain of all wholesome pleasure, the well-spring of all life, 
fit for a man to live.</p>
<p>God condescends to wait for His creature; because what He 
wants is not His creature&rsquo;s fear, but His creature&rsquo;s 
love; not only his obedience, but his heart; because He wants him

<p>The secret of thriving is thrift; saving of force; to get as 
much work as possible done with the least expenditure of power, 
the least jar and obstruction, the least wear and tear.&nbsp; And
the secret of thrift is knowledge.&nbsp; In proportion as you 
know the laws and nature of a subject, you will be able to work 
at it easily, surely, rapidly, successfully, instead of wasting 
your money or your energies in mistaken schemes, irregular 
efforts, which end in disappointment and exhaustion.</p>

<h3>Revelations.&nbsp; August 14.</h3>
<p>Only second-rate hearts and minds are melancholy.&nbsp; When 
we become like little children, our very playfulness tells that 
we are <i>seeing deep</i>, when we see that God is love in His 
<i>works</i> as well as in Himself, and we look at Nature as a 
baby does, as a beautiful mystery which we scarcely wish to 
solve.&nbsp; And therefore deep things, which the intellect in 
vain struggles after, will reveal themselves to us.</p>

<h3>Christ comes in many ways.&nbsp; August 15.</h3>
<p>Often Christ comes to us in ways in which the world would 
never recognise Him&mdash;in which perhaps neither you nor I 
shall recognise <i>Him</i>; but it will be enough, I hope, if we 
but hear His message, and obey His gracious inspiration, let Him 
speak through whatever means He will.&nbsp; He may come to us by 
some crisis in our life, either for sorrow or for bliss.&nbsp; He
may come to us by a great failure; by a great 
disappointment&mdash;to teach the wilful and ambitious soul that 
not in <i>that</i> direction lies the path of peace; or He may 
come in some unexpected happiness to teach that same soul that He
is able and willing to give abundantly beyond all that we can ask
or think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, make us one.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the world-generations

harmony with God and God&rsquo;s universe!&nbsp; Tell us this, 
and the dreary, dark mystery of life, the bright, sparkling 
mystery of life, the cloud-chequered, sun-and-shower mystery of 
life, is solved! for we shall have found one home and one 
brotherhood, and happy faces will greet us wherever we move, and 
we shall see God! see Him everywhere, and be ready to wait for 
the Renewal, for the Kingdom of Christ perfected!&nbsp; We came 
from Eden, all of us: show us how we may return, hand in hand, 
husband and wife, parent and child, gathered together from the 
past and the future, from one creed and another, and take our 
journey into a far country, which is yet this earth&mdash;a 
world-migration to the heavenly Canaan, through the Red Sea of 
Death, back again to the land which was given to our forefathers,
and is ours even now, could we but find it!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Body and Soul.&nbsp; August 18.</h3>
<p>The mystics considered the soul, <i>i.e.</i> the intellect, as
the &ldquo;<i>moi</i>&rdquo; and the body as the &ldquo;<i>non 
moi</i>;&rdquo; and this idea that the body is not <i>self</i>, 
is the fundamental principle of mysticism and asceticism, and 
diametrically opposed to the whole doctrines and practice of 
Scripture.&nbsp; Else why is there a resurrection of the body? 
and why does the Eucharist &ldquo;preserve our body and soul to 
everlasting life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keep a common-place book, and put into it not only facts and

they, unconscious of what and where they are, wrapt up each in 
his little selfish world of vanity and interest, gaze lazily 
around them at earth, sea, and sky&mdash;</p>

<p>To take up the cross means, in the minds of most persons, to 
suffer patiently under affliction.&nbsp; It is a true and sound 
meaning, but it means more.&nbsp; Why did Christ take up the 
cross?&nbsp; Not for affliction&rsquo;s sake, or for the 
cross&rsquo;s sake, as if suffering were a good thing in 
itself.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But that He might thereby <i>do 
good</i>.&nbsp; That the world through Him might be saved.&nbsp; 
That He might do good at whatever cost or pain to Himself.</p>

<p>If I had an image in my room it should be one of Christ

<h3>Love to God proved.&nbsp; August 24.</h3>
<p>Our love to God does not depend upon the emotions of the 
moment.&nbsp; If you fancy you do not love Him enough, above all 
when Satan tempts you to look inward, go immediately and minister
to others; visit the sick, perform some act of self-sacrifice or 
thanksgiving.&nbsp; Never mind how <i>dull</i> you may feel while
doing it; the fact of your feeling excited proves nothing; the 
fact of your <i>doing</i> it proves that your will, your 
spiritual part, is on God&rsquo;s side, however tired or careless
the poor flesh may be.&nbsp; The &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; must be 
brought into harmony with the spirit, not only by physical but by
intellectual mortification.</p>

<p>Be sure that no one knows so little of his fellow-men as the 
cynical, misanthropic man, who walks in darkness because he hates
his brother.&nbsp; Be sure that the truly wise and understanding 
man is he who by sympathy puts himself in his neighbours&rsquo; 
place; feels with them and for them; sees with their eyes, hears 
with their ears; and therefore understands them, makes allowances
for them, and is merciful to them, even as his Father in heaven 
is merciful.</p>

<h3>Penitential Prayer.&nbsp; August 27.</h3>
<p>Faith in God it is which has made the fifty-first Psalm the 
model of all true penitence for evermore.&nbsp; Penitential 
prayers in all ages have too often wanted faith in God, and 
therefore have been too often prayers to avert punishment.&nbsp; 
This, this&mdash;the model of all true penitent prayers&mdash;is 
that of a man who is to be punished, and is content to take his 
punishment, knowing that he deserves it, and far more 
besides.</p>

things come, and say, &ldquo;Oh, Lord! the good in this is Thine 
and not mine; the bad in it is mine and not Thine.&nbsp; I thank 
Thee for having made me do right, for without Thy help I should 
have done nothing but wrong.&nbsp; For mine is the laziness, and 
the weakness, and the selfishness, and the self-conceit; and 
Thine is the kingdom, for Thou rulest all things; and the power, 
for Thou doest all things; and the glory, for Thou doest all 
things well, for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fire which cannot be quenched, a worm which cannot die, I 
see existing, and consider them among the most blessed 
revelations of the gospel.&nbsp; I fancy I see them burning and 
devouring everywhere in the spiritual world, as their analogues 
do in the physical.&nbsp; I know that they have done so on me, 
and that their operation, though exquisitely painful, is most 
healthful.&nbsp; I see the world trying to quench and kill them; 
I know too well that I often do the same ineffectually.&nbsp; 
But, in the comfort that the worm cannot die and the fire cannot 
be quenched, I look calmly forward through endless ages to my own
future, and the future of that world whereof it is written, 
&ldquo;He shall reign until He hath put all enemies under His 
feet, and death and hell shall be cast into the lake of 
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Day of the Lord will be revealed in flaming fire, not 
merely to give new light and a day-spring from on high to those 
who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, but to burn up out 
of sight, and off the universe, the chaff, hay, and stubble which
men have built on the One Living Foundation, Christ, in that 
unquenchable fire, of which it is written that <i>Death</i> and 
<i>Hell</i> shall one day be cast into it also, to share the fate
of all other unnatural and abominable things, and God&rsquo;s 
universe be&mdash;what it must be some day&mdash;<i>very 
good</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Because I believe in a God of absolute and unbounded love, 
therefore I believe in a loving anger of His, which will and must
devour and destroy all which is decayed, monstrous, abortive, in 
His universe, till all enemies shall be put under His feet, to be
pardoned surely, if they confess themselves in the wrong and open
their eyes to the truth.&nbsp; And God shall be All in All.&nbsp;

<p>The lonely fisher, the lover of streams and living fountains, 
knows that when the stream stops it is turbid.&nbsp; The deep 
pools and still flats are always brown&mdash;always

gray with some foreign matter held in solution&mdash;the brown of
selfish sensuality or the gray of morbid melancholy.&nbsp; But 
when they are free again! when they hurry over rock and weed and 
sparkling pebble-shallow, then they are clear!&nbsp; Then all the
foreign matter, the defilement which earth pours into them, falls
to the ground, and into them the trout work up for life and 
health and food; and through their swift yet yielding 
eddies&mdash;<i>moulding themselves to every accident</i>, <i>yet
separate and undefiled</i>&mdash;shine up the delicate beauties 
of the subaqueous world, the Spirit-glories which we can only see
in this life through the medium of another human soul, but which 
we can never see unless that soul is stirred by circumstance into
passion and motion and action strong and swift.&nbsp; Only the

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me, my pastor, what part of God&rsquo;s 
likeness clings to a man longest and closest and best?&nbsp; 
No?&nbsp; Then I will tell you.&nbsp; It is the love of 
employment.&nbsp; God in heaven must create Himself a universe to
work on and love.&nbsp; And now we sons of Adam, the sons of God,
cannot rest without our <i>mundus peculiaris</i> of some 
sort&mdash;our world subjective, as Doctor Musophilus has 
it.&nbsp; But we can create too, and make our little sphere look 
as large as a universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fret not, neither be anxious.&nbsp; What God intends to do He 
will do.&nbsp; And what we ask believing we shall receive.&nbsp; 
Never let us get into the common trick of calling unbelief 
resignation, of asking and then, because we have not faith to 
believe, putting in a &ldquo;Thy will be done&rdquo; at the 
end.&nbsp; Let us make God&rsquo;s will our will, and <i>so</i> 
say Thy will be done.</p>

<h3>Battle before Victory.&nbsp; September 20.</h3>
<p>Whenever you think of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and 
ascension, remember always that the background of His triumph is 
a tomb.&nbsp; Remember that it is the triumph over suffering; a 
triumph of One who still bears the prints of the nails in His 
sacred hands and feet, and the wound of the spear in His side; 
like many a poor soul who has followed Him, triumphant at last, 
and yet scarred, and only not maimed in the hard battle of 
life.</p>

<h3>Night and Growth.&nbsp; September 21.</h3>
<p>As in the world of Nature, so it is in the world of men.&nbsp;
The night is peopled not merely with phantoms and superstitions 
and spirits of evil, but under its shadow all sciences, methods, 
social energies, are taking rest, and growing, and feeding, 
unknown to themselves.</p>

<p>Self-sacrifice!&nbsp; What is love worth that does not show 
itself in action? and more, which does not show itself in 
<i>passion</i> in the true sense of that word: namely, in 
suffering? in daring, in struggling, in grieving, in agonising, 
and, if need be, in dying for the object of its love?&nbsp; Every
mother will give but one answer to that question.</p>

<h3>Worth of Beauty.&nbsp; September 23.</h3>
<p>It is a righteous instinct which bids us welcome and honour 
beauty, whether in man or woman, as something of real 
worth&mdash;divine, heavenly, ay, though we know not how, in a 
most deep sense Eternal; which makes our reason give the lie to 
all merely logical and sentimental maunderings of moralists about
&ldquo;the fleeting hues of this our painted clay;&rdquo; and 
tell men, as the old Hebrew Scriptures told them, that physical 
beauty is the deepest of all spiritual symbols; and that though 
beauty without discretion be the jewel of gold in the 
swine&rsquo;s snout, yet the jewel of gold it is still, the 
sacrament of an inward beauty, which ought to be, perhaps 
hereafter may be, fulfilled in spirit and in truth.</p>

<h3>Empty Profession.&nbsp; September 24.</h3>
<p>What is the sin which most destroys all men and nations?&nbsp;
High religious profession, with an ungodly, selfish life.&nbsp; 
It is the worst and most dangerous of all sins; for it is like a 
disease which eats out the heart and life without giving pain, so
that the sick man never suspects that anything is the matter with
him till he finds himself, to his astonishment, at the point of 
death.</p>

<p>Let us make life one poem&mdash;not of dreams or 
sentiments&mdash;but of actions, not done Byronically as proofs 
of genius, but for our own self-education, alone, in secret, 
awaiting the crisis which shall call us forth to the battle to do
just what other people do, only, perhaps, by an utterly different
self-education.&nbsp; That is the life of great spirits, after, 
perhaps, many many years of seclusion, of silent training in the 
lower paths of God&rsquo;s vineyard, till their hearts have 
settled into a still, deep, yet swift current, and those who have
been faithful over a few things are made rulers over many 
things.</p>

<h3>Office of the Clergy.&nbsp; September 26.</h3>

<h3>Opinions are not Knowledge.&nbsp; September 27.</h3>
<p>. . . As to self-improvement, the true Catholic mode of 
learning is to &ldquo;prove all things,&rdquo; as far as we can, 
without sin or the danger of it, to &ldquo;hold fast that which 
is good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us never be afraid of trying anything 
new, learnt from people of different opinions to our own.&nbsp; 
And let us never be afraid of changing our opinions.&nbsp; The 
unwillingness to go back from once declared opinion is a form of 
pride which haunts some powerful minds: but it is not found in 
great childlike geniuses.&nbsp; Fools may hold fast to their 
scanty stock through life, and we must be very cautious in 
drawing them from it&mdash;for where can they supply its 
place?</p>

<p>Ah, that God&rsquo;s will were but done on earth as it is in

who hath made them sure for ever and ever, and given them a law 
which shall not be broken.&nbsp; But above them; above the divine
and wonderful order of the material universe, and the winds which
are God&rsquo;s angels, and the flames of fire which are His 
messengers; above all, the prophets and apostles have caught 
sight of another divine and wonderful order of <i>rational</i> 
beings, of races loftier and purer than man&mdash;angels and

<h3>True Resignation.&nbsp; September 30.</h3>
<p>. . . Christianity heightens as well as deepens the human as

hope, the more faith. . . .&nbsp; God knows what is best for us; 
we do not.&nbsp; Continual resignation, at last I begin to find,

<p>There is something higher than happiness.&nbsp; There is 
blessedness; the blessedness of being good and doing good, of

<p>The eternal moral law which held good for the sinless Christ, 
who, though He were a Son, yet learned obedience by the things 
which He suffered, must hold good of you and me, and all moral 
and rational beings&mdash;yea, for the very angels in 
heaven.&nbsp; They have not sinned.&nbsp; That we know; and we do
not know that they have ever suffered.&nbsp; But this at least we
know, that they have submitted.&nbsp; They have obeyed, and have 
given up their own wills to be ministers of God&rsquo;s 
will.&nbsp; In them is neither self-will nor selfishness; and, 
therefore, by faith, that is, by trust and loyalty, they 
stand.&nbsp; And so, by consenting to lose their individual life 
of selfishness, they have saved their eternal life in God, the 
life of blessedness and holiness, just as all evil spirits have 
lost their eternal life by trying to save their selfish life and 
be something in themselves and of themselves without respect to 
God.</p>

<p>A beautiful October morning it was; one of those in which Dame
Nature, healthily tired with the revelry of summer, is composing 
herself, with a quiet satisfied smile, for her winter&rsquo;s 
sleep.&nbsp; Sheets of dappled cloud were sliding slowly from the
west; long bars of hazy blue hung over the southern chalk downs, 
which gleamed pearly gray beneath the low south-eastern 
sun.&nbsp; In the vale below, soft white flakes of mist still 
hung over the water meadows, and barred the dark trunks of the 
huge elms and poplars, whose fast-yellowing leaves came showering
down at every rustle of the western breeze, spotting the grass 
below.&nbsp; The river swirled along, glassy no more, but dingy 
gray with autumn rains and rotting leaves.&nbsp; All beyond the 
garden told of autumn, bright and peaceful even in decay; but up 
the sunny slope of the garden itself, and to the very 
window-sill, summer still lingered.&nbsp; The beds of red verbena
and geranium were still brilliant, though choked with fallen 
leaves of acacia and plane; the canary plant, still untouched by 
frost, twined its delicate green leaves, and more delicate yellow
blossoms, through the crimson lace-work of the Virginia creeper; 
and the great yellow noisette swung its long canes across the 
window, filling all the air with fruity fragrance.</p>

<h3>The Forming Form.&nbsp; October 2.</h3>
<p>As the acorn, because God has given it &ldquo;a forming

the builder oak but shade for many a herd, food for countless 
animals, and at last the gallant ship itself, and the materials 
of every use to which Nature or Art can put it, and its 
descendants after it, throughout all time, so does every good 
deed contain within itself endless and unexpected possibilities 
of other good, which may and will grow and multiply for ever, in

whose eternal spirit will for ever quicken it, with that life of

intellect, and the worship of intellect and art and poetry, . . .

<h3>Mountain-Ranges.&nbsp; October 8.</h3>
<p>We fancy there are many independent sciences, because we stand
half-way up on different mountain-peaks, calling to each other 
from isolated stations.&nbsp; The mists hide from us the foot of 
the range beneath us, the depths of primary analysis to which 
none can reach, or we should see that all the peaks were but 
offsets of one vast mountain-base, and in their inmost root but 
One!&nbsp; And the clouds which float between us and the heaven 
shroud from us the sun-lighted caps themselves&mdash;the perfect 
issues of synthetic science, on which the Sun of Righteousness 
shines with undimmed lustre&mdash;and keep us from perceiving 
that the complete practical details of our applied knowledge is 
all holy and radiant with God&rsquo;s smile.&nbsp; And so, 
half-way up, on the hillside, beneath a cloudy sky, we build up 
little earthy hill-cairns of our own petty synthesis, and fancy 
them Babel-towers whose top shall reach to heaven!</p>

<h3>The Temper for Success in Life.&nbsp; October 9.</h3>
<p>The men whom I have seen succeed best in life have always been
cheerful and hopeful men, who went about their business with a

<p>Faith and prayer are simple things, . . . but when we begin to

from the worst weariness of all&mdash;knowing one&rsquo;s duty 
and not being able to do it.&nbsp; That is true rest; the rest of
God who works for ever, and yet is at rest for ever; as the stars
over our heads move for ever, thousands of miles a day, and yet 
are at perfect rest, because they move orderly, harmoniously, 
fulfilling the law which God has given them.&nbsp; Perfect rest

<p>Morbid melancholy results from subjectivity of mind.&nbsp; The
self-contemplating mind, if it be a conscientious and feeling

begins unconsciously to flatter itself with the idea that it is 
not the &ldquo;<i>moi</i>&rdquo; but the &ldquo;<i>non

comes Manich&aelig;ism, Asceticism, and that morbid tone of mind 
which is so accustomed to look for sorrow that it finds it even 
in joy&mdash;because it will not confess to itself that sorrow 
belongs to <i>sin</i>, and that sin belongs to <i>self</i>; and 
therefore it vents its dissatisfaction on God&rsquo;s earth, and 
not on itself in repentance and humiliation.</p>
<p>The world looks dark.&nbsp; Shall we therefore be dark

man is felt more and more to be necessary in health as he is in

<h3>The only Path to Light.&nbsp; October 20.</h3>
<p>The path by which some come to see the Light, to find the Rock

self-renunciation, self-restraint, in which every upward step 
towards right exposes some fresh depth of inward sinfulness, till
the once proud man, crushed down by the sense of his own infinite
meanness, becomes a little child once more, and casts himself 
simply on the generosity of Him who made him.&nbsp; And then 
there may come to him the vision, dim, perhaps, and fitting ill 
into clumsy words, but clearer, surer, nearer to him than the 
ground on which he treads, or than the foot which treads 
it&mdash;the vision of an Everlasting Spiritual Substance, most 
Human and yet most Divine, who can endure; and who, standing 
beneath all things, can make their spiritual substance endure 
likewise, though all worlds and eons, birth and growth and death,
matter and space and time, should melt indeed&mdash;</p>

<h3>The Cross a Token.&nbsp; October 24.</h3>
<p>Have patience, have faith, have hope, as thou standest at the 
foot of Christ&rsquo;s Cross, and holdest fast to it, the anchor 
of the <i>soul</i> and <i>reason</i>, as well as of the 
<i>heart</i>.&nbsp; For, however ill the world may go, or seem to
go, the Cross is the everlasting token that God so loved the 
world that He spared not His only-begotten Son, but freely gave 
Him for it.&nbsp; Whatsoever else is doubtful, that at least is 
sure&mdash;that good must conquer, because God is good, that evil
must perish, because God hates evil, even to the death.</p>

<p>Men can be as original now as ever, if they had but the 
courage, even the insight.&nbsp; Heroic souls in old times had no
more opportunities than we have; but they used them.&nbsp; There 
were daring deeds to be done then&mdash;are there none now?&nbsp;
Sacrifices to be made&mdash;are there none now?&nbsp; Wrongs to 
be redrest&mdash;are there none now?&nbsp; Let any one set his 
heart in these days to do what is right, and nothing else; and it
will not be long ere his brow is stamped with all that goes to 
make up the heroical expression&mdash;with noble indignation, 
noble self-restraint, great hopes, great sorrows; perhaps even 
with the print of the martyr&rsquo;s crown of thorns.</p>

<h3>Nature&rsquo;s Permanence.&nbsp; October 29.</h3>
<p>We abolish many things, good and evil, wisely and foolishly, 
in these fast-going times; but, happily for us, we cannot abolish
the blue sky, and the green sea, and the white foam, and the 
everlasting hills, and the rivers which flow out of their 
bosoms.&nbsp; They will abolish themselves when their work is 
done, but not before.&nbsp; And we, who, with all our boasted 
scientific mastery over Nature, are, from a merely mechanical and
carnal point of view, no more than a race of minute parasitic 
animals burrowing in the fair Earth&rsquo;s skin, had better, 
instead of boasting of our empire over Nature, take care lest we 
become too troublesome to Nature, by creating, in our haste and 
greed, too many great black countries, and too many great dirty 
warrens of houses, miscalled cities, peopled with savages and 
imps of our own mis-creation; in which case Nature, so far from 
allowing us to abolish her, will by her inexorable laws abolish 
us.</p>

<p>Among the higher-hearted of the early voyagers, the grandeur 
and glory around them had attuned their spirits to itself and 
kept them in a lofty, heroical, reverent frame of mind; while 
they knew as little about what they saw in an 
&ldquo;artistic&rdquo; or &ldquo;critical&rdquo; point of view as
in a scientific one. . . .&nbsp; They gave God thanks and were 
not astonished.&nbsp; God was great: but that they had discovered
long before they came into the tropics.</p>
<p>Noble old child-hearted heroes, with just romance and 
superstition enough about them to keep from that prurient 
hysterical wonder and enthusiasm which is simply, one often 
fears, a product of our scepticism!&nbsp; We do not trust enough 
in God, we do not really believe His power enough, to be ready, 
as they were, as every one ought to be on a God-made earth, for 
anything and everything being possible; and then when a wonder is
discovered we go into ecstasies and shrieks over it, and take to 
ourselves credit for being susceptible of so lofty a 
feeling&mdash;true index, forsooth, of a refined and cultivated 
mind!!</p>
<p>Smile if you will: but those were days (and there never were 
less superstitious ones) in which Englishmen believed in the 
living God, and were not ashamed to acknowledge, as a matter of 
course, His help, and providence, and calling, in the matters of 
daily life, which we now, in our covert atheism, term 
&ldquo;secular and carnal.&rdquo;</p>

St. Luke, Physician and Evangelist.</h4>
<p>It is good to follow Christ in one thing and to follow Him 
utterly in that.&nbsp; And the physician has set his mind to do 
one thing&mdash;to hate calmly, but with an internecine hatred, 
disease and death, and to fight against them to the end.&nbsp; In
his exclusive care for the body the physician witnesses 
unconsciously yet mightily for the soul, for God, for the Bible, 
for immortality.&nbsp; Is he not witnessing for God when he shows
by his acts that he believes God to be a God of life, not of 
death; of health, not of disease; of order, not of disorder; of 
joy and strength, not of misery and weakness?&nbsp; Is he not 
witnessing for Christ when, like Christ, he heals all manner of 
sickness and disease among the people, and attacks physical evil 
as the natural foe of man and of the Creator of man?</p>

comes first, then happiness may come after; but if not, something
better than happiness may come, even blessedness.</p>
<p>Oh! sad hearts and suffering! look to the Cross.&nbsp; There

King of Sorrows.&nbsp; Ay, pain and grief, tyranny and desertion,
death and hell,&mdash;He has faced them one and all, and tried 
their strength and taught them His, and conquered them right 
royally.&nbsp; And since He hung upon that torturing Cross sorrow
is divine,&mdash;godlike, as joy itself.&nbsp; All that 
man&rsquo;s fallen nature dreads and despises God honoured on the
Cross, and took unto Himself, and blest and consecrated for ever.
. . .&nbsp; And now&mdash;Blessed are tears and shame, blessed

the great organic world is still living and growing and feeding, 
unseen by us all the night through; and every phosphoric atom

<h3>An absolutely Good God.&nbsp; November 8.</h3>
<p>Fix in your minds&mdash;or rather ask God to fix in your 
minds&mdash;this one idea of an absolutely good God; good with 
all forms of goodness which you respect and love in man; good, as
you, and I, and every honest man, understand the plain word 
good.&nbsp; Slowly you will acquire that grand and 
all-illuminating idea; slowly and most imperfectly at best: for 
who is mortal man that he should conceive and comprehend the 
goodness of the infinitely good God!&nbsp; But see, then, 
whether, in the light of that one idea, all the old-fashioned 
Christian ideas about the relation of God to man&mdash;whether 
Providence, Prayer, Inspiration, Revelation, the Incarnation, the
Passion, and the final triumph of the Son of God&mdash;do not 
seem to you, not merely beautiful, not merely probable, but 
rational, and logical, and necessary, moral consequences from the
one idea of an Absolute and Eternal Goodness, the Living Parent 
of the universe?</p>

<h3>Nature&rsquo;s Lesson.&nbsp; November 9.</h3>

<p>Not upon mind, not upon mind, but upon morals, is human 
welfare founded.&nbsp; The true subjective history of man is not 
the history of his thought, but of his conscience: the true 
objective history of man is not that of his inventions, but of 
his vices and his virtues.&nbsp; So far from morals depending 
upon thought, thought, I believe, depends on morals.&nbsp; In 
proportion as a nation is righteous&mdash;in proportion as common
justice is done between man and man, will thought grow rapidly, 
securely, triumphantly; will its discoveries be cheerfully 
accepted and faithfully obeyed, to the welfare of the whole 
common weal.</p>

sea when he was big enough.&nbsp; Neither was he what would be 
nowadays called by many a pious child, for though he said his 
Creed and Lord&rsquo;s Prayer night and morning, and went to 
service at the church every forenoon, and read the day&rsquo;s 
Psalms with his mother every evening, and had learnt from her and
his father that it was infinitely noble to do right and 
infinitely base to do wrong, yet he knew nothing more of theology
or of his own soul than is contained in the Church Catechism.</p>

wise self-distrust, by silent labour, by lofty self-control, by 
that charity which hopeth all things, believeth all things, 
endureth all things; by such an example, in short, as women now

literal fact once more blossom as the rose.&nbsp; And just so can
I conceive a time when by a higher civilisation, formed on a 
political economy more truly scientific, because more truly 
according to the will of God, our human refuse shall be utilised 
like our material refuse; when man as man, down to the weakest 
and most ignorant, shall be found (as he really is) so valuable 
that it will be worth while to preserve his health, to develop 
his capabilities, to save him alive, body, intellect, and 
character, at any cost; because men will see that a man is, after
all, the most precious and useful thing on the earth, and that no
cost spent on the development of human beings can possibly be 
thrown away.</p>

untrue to God.&nbsp; If you will not do the thing you know to be

weak.&nbsp; You are a coward; you desert God.</p>

<h3>Blind Faith.&nbsp; November 27.</h3>
<p>In Him&mdash;&ldquo;The Father&rdquo;&mdash;I can trust, in 
spite of the horrible things I see happen, in spite of the fact 
that my own prayers are not answered.&nbsp; I believe that He 
makes all things work together for the good of the human race, 
and of me among the rest, as long as I obey His will.&nbsp; I 
believe He will answer my prayer, not according to the letter, 
but according to the spirit of it; that if I desire good, I shall
find good, though not <i>the</i> good I longed for.</p>

<p>Begin with small things&mdash;you cannot enter into the 
presence of another human being without finding there more to do 
than you or I or any soul will ever learn to do perfectly before 
we die.&nbsp; Let us be content to do little if God sets us 
little tasks.&nbsp; It is but pride and self-will which says, 
&ldquo;Give me something huge to fight and I shall enjoy

<h3>True and False.&nbsp; November 29.</h3>
<p>We must remember that dissatisfaction at existing evil (the 
feeling of all young and ardent minds), the struggle to escape 
from the &ldquo;circumstance&rdquo; of the evil world, has a 
carnal counterfeit&mdash;the love of novelty, and self-will, and 
self-conceit, which may thrust us down into the abysses of 
misrule and uncertainty; as it has done such men as Shelley and 
Byron; trying vainly every loophole, beating against the prison 
bars of an imperfect system; neither degraded enough to make 
themselves a fool&rsquo;s paradise within it, nor wise enough to 
escape from it through Christ, &ldquo;the door into the 
sheepfold,&rdquo; to return when they will, and bring others with
them into the serene empyrean of spiritual truth&mdash;truth 
which explains, and arranges, and hallows, and subdues 
everything.</p>

<h3>The Mind of Christ.&nbsp; November 30.</h3>
<p>How can we attain to the blessed and noble state of 
mind&mdash;the mind of Christ, who must needs be about His 
Father&rsquo;s business, which is doing good?&nbsp; Only by 
prayer and practice.&nbsp; There is no more use in praying 
without practising than there is in practising without 
praying.&nbsp; You cannot learn to walk without walking; no more 
can you learn to do good without trying to do good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any man serve Me, him will My Father honour,&rdquo; 
said the Blessed One.&nbsp; And if God honours His servants, 
shall not we honour them likewise?&nbsp; We may not, as our 
forefathers did blindly, though lovingly, worship them as 
mediators and lesser gods, and pray to them instead of to their 
Father in heaven to whose throne of grace we may all come boldly 
through Christ Jesus, or believe that their relics will work 
miracles in our behalf, thus honouring the creature instead of 
the Creator.&nbsp; This we may not do, but we may honour the 
Creator in His creature, and honour God in those who have lived 
godly and God-like lives; and when they have passed away from 
among us&mdash;souls endued by God with manifold virtues and 
precious gifts of grace&mdash;we may give thanks and say, These, 
O God, are the fruits of Thy Spirit.&nbsp; Thou honourest them in
heaven with Thy approving smile.&nbsp; We will honour them on 
earth, not merely with our lips, but in our lives.&nbsp; What 
they were we too might be, if we were as true as they to the 
inspiration of Thy Spirit.&nbsp; Help us to honour their 
memories, as Thou and they would have us do, by following their 
example; by setting them before us, and not only them, but every 
holy and noble personage of whom we have ever heard, as dim 
likenesses of Christ&mdash;even as Christ is the likeness of 
Thee.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p>It chanced upon the merry, merry Christmas eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I went sighing past the Church across the moorland 
dreary:<br />
&ldquo;Oh! never sin and want and woe this earth will leave,<br

so cheery.<br />
How long, O Lord! how long before Thou come again?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in cellar and in garret, and on moorland 
dreary,<br />
The orphans moan, and widows weep, and poor men toil in vain:<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till earth is sick of hope deferred, though 
Christmas bells be cheery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then arose a joyous clamour from the wild-fowl on the mere,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the stars across the snow, like clear bells 
ringing,<br />
And a voice within cried, &ldquo;Listen!&nbsp; Christmas carols 
even here!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though thou be dumb, yet o&rsquo;er their work the 
stars and snows are singing.<br />
Blind!&nbsp; I live, I love, I reign, and all the nations 
through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the thunder of my judgments even now are 
ringing;<br />
Do thou fulfil thy work but as yon wild-fowl do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt heed no less the wailing, yet hear through
it the angels&rsquo; singing.&rdquo;</p>

if he be self-willed and break them, there is an end of his music
instantly; all he brings out is discord and ugly sounds.</p>

fancies that he has nothing left to learn from cultivated 
women.&nbsp; I should have thought that the very mission of woman
was to be, in the highest sense, the educator of man, from 
infancy to old age; that that was the work towards which all the

<p>Out of God&rsquo;s boundless bosom, the fount of life, we 
came; through selfish, stormy youth, and contrite 
tears&mdash;just not too late; through manhood, not altogether 
useless; through slow and chill old age, we return whence we 
came, to the bosom of God once more&mdash;to go forth again, it 
may be, with fresh knowledge and fresh powers, to nobler 
work.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<h4>DECEMBER 21.<br />
St. Thomas, Apostle and Martyr.</h4>
<p>The spirits of just men made perfect, freed from the fetters 
of the gross animal body, and now somewhere in that boundless 
universe in which this earth is but a tiny speck, doing 
God&rsquo;s will as they longed to do it on earth, with clearer 
light, fuller faith, deeper love, mightier powers of 
usefulness!&nbsp; Ah, that we were like unto them!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>All Saints&rsquo; Day and other

<h4>DECEMBER 25.<br />
Christmas Day.</h4>
<p>Thank God, that One was born, at this same time,<br />
Who did our work for us: we&rsquo;ll talk of Him:<br />
We shall go mad with thinking of ourselves&mdash;<br />
We&rsquo;ll talk of Him, and of that new-made star,<br />
Which, as He stooped into the Virgin&rsquo;s side,<br />
From off His finger, like a signet-gem,<br />
He dropped in the empyrean for a sign.<br />
But the first tear He shed at this His birth-hour,<br />
When He crept weeping forth to see our woe,<br />
Fled up to Heaven in mist, and hid for ever<br />
Our sins, our works, and that same new-made star.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Saint&rsquo;s Tragedy</i>, Act 
iv. Scene iv.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER 26.<br />
St. Stephen, the Martyr.</h4>
<p>These are the holy ones&mdash;the heroes of mankind, the 
elect, the aristocracy of grace.&nbsp; They are those who carry 
the palm branch of triumph, who have come out of great 
tribulation, who have dared and fought and suffered for God and 
truth and right; who have resisted unto blood, striving against 
sin.&nbsp; What should easy-going folk like you and me do but 
place ourselves with all humility, if but for an hour, where we 
can look afar off upon our betters, and see what they are like 
and what they do.</p>

<h4><!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>DECEMBER 27.<br />
St. John, Apostle and Evangelist.</h4>
<p>And what do they do, these blessed beings?&nbsp; They longed 
for, toiled for, it may be died for, the true, the beautiful, and
the good; they entered while on earth into the mystery and glory 
of self-sacrifice, and now they find their bliss in gazing on the
one perfect and eternal sacrifice, and rejoicing in the thought 
that it is the cause and ground of the whole universe, even the 
Lamb slain before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>All Saints&rsquo; Day and other 
Sermons</i>.</p>
<h4>DECEMBER 28<br />
Holy Innocents&rsquo; Day.</h4>
<p>Christ comes to us in many ways.&nbsp; But most surely does 
Christ come to us, and often most happily, and most clearly does 
He speak to us&mdash;in the face of a little child, fresh out of 
heaven.&nbsp; Ah, let us take heed that we despise not one of 
these little ones, lest we despise our Lord Himself.&nbsp; For as
often as we enter into communion with little children, so often 
does Christ come to us.&nbsp; So often, as in Jud&aelig;a of old,
does He take a little child and set him in the midst of us, that 
from its simplicity, docility, and trust&mdash;the restless, the 
mutinous, and the ambitious may learn the things which belong to 
their peace&mdash;so often does He say to us, &ldquo;Except ye be
changed and become as this little child, ye shall in no wise 
enter into the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Take my yoke upon you and
learn of me.&nbsp; For I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall
find rest unto your souls.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
